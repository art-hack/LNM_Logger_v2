**LNM Login Assistant** is a assistant that helps you by automatically logging you back in automatically whenever you get logged out of the college internet.

When you install and run, assistant will start in the **task bar**, just **Enter credentials** by **Right-Clicking** on it.

Rest will be taken care by the Assistant itself.

**Note: Assistant will only work after 60 sec of internet logout**
